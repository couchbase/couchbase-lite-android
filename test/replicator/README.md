# Replicator Test Data

This directory contains Sync Gateway configuration* and databases for use with LiteCore's `ReplicatorAPITests` unit tests, specifically those tests tagged with `[.RealReplicator]`. These currently don't run automatically, because they require a Sync Gateway to be running.

(Similarly, couchbase-lite-ios also has some disabled Objective-C unit tests that connect to this server.)

1. Install the latest build of Sync Gateway 2.0 (or later).
2. Open a command shell at this directory.
3. `sync_gateway config.json`

If you want to run a second Sync Gateway instance with SSL, to test SSL connections (there aren't currently any LiteCore tests for this, but there's a Couchbase Lite/iOS one), do this:

4. Open another shell at this directory
5. `sync_gateway ssl_config.json`

This uses a self-signed certificate. You can find a copy of the certificate at `cert.pem`; if you need a binary (DER) version, there's one checked into couchbase-lite-ios as `SelfSigned.cer`.

>* **SECURITY WARNING:** The configuration file here opens the admin port (4985) to the network, to allow the unit tests to run on a different device (such as a phone) and still be able to erase server databases. This is **far too insecure** for use with anything other than test data! Donâ€™t copy this config.json and use it for your own configurations, at least without removing the `adminInterface` property.
